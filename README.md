# Dialogflow CX Codelabs

**By Lee Boonstra, Conversational AI Developer Advocate @ Google Cloud.**

This repository contains advanced Dialogflow CX labs.
Eventually these labs will be moved over to the [Google Codelab platform](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/).

## Labs

* [Lab 1: Build a complex retail virtual agent with Dialogflow CX](https://github.com/savelee/dialogflow-cx-labs/blob/master/labs/lab1.md) - Learn Flows, Pages, State Handlers (Intent Routes, Conditional Routes), Static Fulfillments & Conditional Responses, Simulator and Dialogflow CX Test Cases. 

## TODO

* Lab 2: Build a webhook for your virtual agent
* Lab 3: Build a custom integration (Dialogflow CX channel)
* Lab 4: Build a virtual agent for voice (Phone Gateway)


## Dialogflow Prototyper
These sets of labs make use of my [Dialogflow CX Prototyper](https://ccai-360.nw.r.appspot.com/#/) tool, to draw out diagrams.
